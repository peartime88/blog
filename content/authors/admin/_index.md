Hi, I'm Yang! I'm a PhD student in the [Biomedical Sciences Program](https://biomedsci.ucsd.edu/) specializing in bioinformatics at UC San Diego. I am co-advised by the [Gallo lab](https://dermatology.ucsd.edu/research/basic-science/gallo-lab/index.html) and the [Knight lab](https://knightlab.ucsd.edu/wordpress/) where my research broadly focuses on how microbes contribute to disease and developing computational tools to aid in microbiome statistical analyses. These days I am learning a lot of coding and data science skills through my research, which I hope to document here. 

I love fitness, live music, and sharing a good meal with others. Though, at any given time you will probably more likely find me staring at either my computer or my lava lamp. I am a first-generation Chinese-American from the Midwest, and I speak fluent English and Mandarin.
